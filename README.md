<h1>Project Goal</h1>
<p>Create a data analysis workflow that will quantify the presence, location, and severity of Weather Whiplash Events (WWE) across the state of California using publicly available data concerning precipitation, temperature, and/or dryness index.</p>

<h1>Background Information</h1>
<h3>Weather Whiplash</h3>
<p>Weather Whiplash Events (WWE) are "an abrupt transition from one persistent, continental-scale atmospheric pattern to a different regime" (Francis et al., 2022), such as a warm front in th middle of winter weather or heavy precipitation after a period of drought. These WWEs cause disruptions to agriculture, ecosystems, infrastructure, and human activities. A recent major WWE was in California, which experienced a 3 year extensive drought from 2020-2022 characterized by only 25% of their average annual precipitation. In a span of one month in 2023 however, they recieved half of their annual precipitation and the largest snowpack since 1983, which ended the drought but also led to severe flooding (SOURCE).</p>
<h3>Mimulus</h3>
<p>Mimulus, common name Monkeyflower, is a genus found along the west coast, primarily across California, Nevada, Oregan, and Washington. There are multiple species, each with their own distinct life histories, such as M. guttatus which is found in wet creek soil that become flooded for several months of the year, or M. nudatus which is found in drought-prone rocky soils. Mimulus is a well established model system for the study of evolutionary and ecological functional genomics, including habitat adaptations, due to its phenotypic, ecological and genomic diversity (Wu et al., 2008).</p>
